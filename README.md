NTU FYP: RobotX Development of Surface Vehicle's Visual Perception of Dynamic Features
==================================================
Hardware
--------
Designed a test rig since it will not be mounted on the USV.

1 x Arducam 64MP Camera https://amicus.com.sg/index.php?route=product/product&manufacturer_id=79&product_id=8222

1 x Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB

Software
--------
The main difference between _rasp.py and _windows.py code lies in their image capture functions. _rasp.py is tailored for compatibility with the Arducam 64MP, while _windows.py has been tested using the Logitech C920.

Note: Change the folder path in the code to your desired destination.
